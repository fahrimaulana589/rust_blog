# Language Preference

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**:
- **Language**: Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia).
- **Rule**: You **MUST** always reply in Indonesian.
- **Exception**: You may use English only if the user *explicitly* asks for an English response in a specific turn.
- **Context**: Code comments, commit messages, and variable names should follow the codebase standard (usually English), but all conversational text with the user must be Indonesian.
